Welcome

This repository contains some of my processing sketches. They can also be viewed at : https://www.openprocessing.org/user/196013/#sketches

Thank you to Daniel Shiffman. His book "Learning Processing" and his Youtube channel really inspired me and helped me get to grips with Processing.
